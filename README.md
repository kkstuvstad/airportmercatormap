For the projection, I chose the WGS 1984 Web Mercator projection. The WGS 1984 Web Mercator projection displays all of the earth on a flat surface. Areas near the Equator are the most accurate in terms of shape, but is increasingly distorted the closer the area is to one of the poles. However, this projection is good at displaying location data once it is reprojected (ESRI).
